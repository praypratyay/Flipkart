## QUICK NOTES

- react creates reusable components

- props are used as parameters that you are passing to a function

- default export vs named export

- map function is used for iterating with items

- useState functions as a hook in JS

- state variables with setter functions is used for maintaning state and re-rendering

- useEffect is also a hook which has a callBack on dependencyArray(empty/state variables/props)

- fetch is used for API call

- then is used with function() for structuring responses and updating states

- context is used to avoid prop drilling where same data is passed from parent to children continuously

- inbuilt functions are used for creating, providing and using contexts
